Subjects were recruited from study clinics and through media\n\n      campaigns.First-degree relatives, 3 to 45 years of age, and second-degree relatives, 3 to 20\n\n      years of age, of patients with diabetes were screened for islet-cell antibodies.

          "\n      Primary Objectives: To measure the prevalence of undiagnosed Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and the\n\n      annual incidence of new cases of DM among veterans between the ages of 45 and 64 and to\n\n      compare the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of veterans with undiagnosed DM to those\n\n      without DM but who are at comparable risk for DM, both at baseline and over three years of\n\n      follow-up.\n\n\n\n      Secondary Objectives: To describe the clinical state of veterans with diabetes newly\n\n      diagnosed by screening and to describe the process of usual care for veterans with diabetes\n\n      newly diagnosed by screening.\n\n\n\n      Primary Outcomes: The primary outcomes are: 1) prevalence of undiagnosed\n\n      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM); 2) HRQoL as measured by SF-36; 3) glycemic\n\n      control as measured by HbA1C; and 4) calculation of the 3-year direct utilization-related\n\n      cost, from the perspective of the VA, associated with early diagnosis of DM, and comparison\n\n      of this to the 3-year direct utilization-related cost for veterans who are screened for\n\n      diabetes but do not have diabetes.\n\n\n\n      Intervention: N/A\n\n\n\n      Study Abstract: Population-based screening for diabetes mellitus in non-pregnant adults\n\n      remains controversial. For a screening strategy to be successful, patients identified by\n\n      surveillance will have to have better outcomes than if they had been diagnosed at a later,\n\n      more symptomatic phase of disease. However, little is known about the fate of patients\n\n      diagnosed with diabetes by screening. Additionally, while about half of the cases of diabetes\n\n      among the general population at any given time are undiagnosed, the prevalence of undiagnosed\n\n      diabetes among veterans is unknown. The annual incidence of diabetes among veterans is also\n\n      unknown.\n\n\n\n      A mail-out survey for this study was completed with 10,350 surveys mailed and 4,500 surveys\n\n      returned (43%). Enrollment concluded 7/31/99 with 1,253 new subjects enrolled. Follow-up of\n\n      the enrolled subjects is ongoing. Some descriptive analyses of the data revealed the\n\n      prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes was 4.5%. Factors associated with unrecognized diabetes\n\n      were the diagnosis of hypertension and history of a parent or sibling with diabetes. Having a\n\n      primary care provider did not raise or lower the risk for unrecognized diabetes. Based on the\n\n      new diagnosis, most patients found to have diabetes required a change in treatment either of\n\n      their blood sugar or comorbid hypertension or hyperlipidemia in order to achieve targets\n\n      recommended in published treatment guidelines. Patients reporting a primary care provider\n\n      were no less likely to require a change in treatment.\n\n\n\n      Conclusions: If diabetes screening is an effective intervention, opportunistic screening for\n\n      diabetes may be the preferred method for screening, as there is substantial potential for\n\n      case-finding in a medical center outpatient setting. A majority of patients with diabetes\n\n      diagnosed at opportunistic screening will require a change in treatment of blood sugar, blood\n\n      pressure, or lipids to receive optimal care.\n\n    ",

Researchers will\n\n      attempt to associate obesity with the presence of heart disease risk factors. Risk factors\n\n      that will be studied include; total body fat, body fat distribution, fat content of the blood\n\n      (triglyceride concentration, low density lipoproteins [LDL], and high density lipoproteins\n\n      [HDL]), how fast fat is removed from the blood, and how well insulin works in the body.\n\n\n\n      Scientific studies have shown that obesity and increased levels of fat content in the blood\n\n      are important risk factors for heart disease in Caucasian women. However, similar studies in\n\n      African American women have failed to show the same correlation. In fact, it appears that\n\n      African American women in all three body weight groupings, nonobese, overweight, and obese\n\n      experience high death rates due to heart disease. In addition, prior research has shown that\n\n      obese African American men tend to have elevated levels of fat in the blood while African\n\n      American women have normal blood fat levels. Therefore, if high levels of triglycerides (fat\n\n      found in the blood) are not seen in non-diabetic obese African American women, it cannot be\n\n      considered a risk factor in this population. This suggests that studies conducted on\n\n      Caucasian women may not provide insight into heart disease risk factors in African American\n\n      women.\n\n\n\n      The study will take 2000 healthy non-diabetic African American men and women (ages 18-70) and\n\n      body mass index 3 subgroups; nonobese, overweight and obese. Diabetes undeniably increases\n\n      the risk of heart disease. Therefore patients suffering from diabetes will not be included in\n\n      the study. Candidates for the study will undergo a series of tests and examinations over 2\n\n      outpatient visits. Subjects will have body fat analyses, resting energy expenditure\n\n      measurements, an EKG (electrocardiogram), and specific blood tests.\n\n\n\n      Researchers believe this study will provide significant insight into the causes of obesity\n\n      and heart disease in African Americans.\n\n    ",
          "\n      This study is designed to investigate in blacks the relationship of risk for diabetes and\n\n      heart disease from obesity plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations and the\n\n      triglyceride related risk factors of small dense low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density\n\n      lipoprotein (HDL) and central obesity.\n\n\n\n      The Framingham Study demonstrated that obesity and elevated glucose and triglyceride levels\n\n      are important risk factors for coronary artery disease in white women. However, studies that\n\n      have had significant participation of black women such as the Charleston Heart Study, failed\n\n      to show a relationship of obesity or triglyceride to coronary artery disease mortality in\n\n      black women. In fact, black women independent of body weight or triglyceride levels\n\n      experience high mortality from coronary artery disease. Our earlier research has demonstrated\n\n      that obese black men have elevated triglyceride levels but obese black women have normal\n\n      triglyceride levels. Consequently if elevated triglyceride levels do not occur in obese\n\n      nondiabetic black women, then elevated triglyceride levels may not represent a major\n\n      cardiovascular risk for black women.\n\n\n\n      The study, Diabetes and Heart Disease Risk in Blacks, is designed to determine the role of\n\n      obesity, glucose and triglyceride on risk for heart disease in blacks. For this study of\n\n      blacks, we will study 2 groups, African Americans and Black Africans living in the United\n\n      States. African Americans must self-identify as African American, be born in the United\n\n      States and have parents who self-identify as African American and were born in the United\n\n      States. The second group will be blacks living in the United States but were born in Africa\n\n      and whose parents were born in Africa.\n\n\n\n      We will recruit 2000 healthy, non-diabetic individuals (), age range 18- 70, and body mass\n\n      index (3 subgroups: nonobese, overweight and obese). In 2 outpatient visits to the Clinical\n\n      Center, participants will have body fat analyses, an electrocardiogram, an oral glucose\n\n      tolerance test, questionnaires about sleep and stress and an intravenous glucose tolerance\n\n      test or a beverage tolerance test. This study has the potential to provide significant\n\n      insight and lead to the development of programs that help decrease diabetes and\n\n      cardiovascular risk in blacks.\n\n    ",
          "\n        Healthy volunteers of African descent,specifically African-born blacks and African\n\n        Americans, recruited from the local area by flyer, newspaper advertisements, word of mouth\n\n        and study personnel describing the study at community events.\n\n      ",
          "\n        -  IINCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA\n\n\n\n        CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION:\n\n\n\n        Ethnicity: Black\n\n\n\n        This is a study of adult African Americans and Blacks that were born in Africa but are now\n\n        living in the United States. As African American people are multi-ethnic, we will in this\n\n        initial investigation, study two different groups of African American. To enroll\n\n        participants must self-identify as African Americans and be born in the United States, with\n\n        American born parents or be born in Africa with African born parents. In both groups we\n\n        will study sex differences in the role of obesity and TG levels on cardiovascular disease.\n\n        In the future, we plan to expand the study to include other groups which self-identify as\n\n        African Americans (i.e.AfroCarribeans and Hispanic blacks).\n\n\n\n        Only blacks are included in this study because the focus of this study is on gender\n\n        differences in blacks in risk factors for CAD, specifically obesity, TG levels and TG\n\n        related CAD risk factors. Unlike Caucasian women, premenopausal black women do not appear\n\n        to be as protected from heart disease as a result of their gender. One model to study this\n\n        apparent decrease in gender\n\n\n\n        related cardioprotection in black women is to compare black men to black women. An\n\n        alternative model would be to compare black women to Caucasian women. However, since the\n\n        primary focus of this work is on gender differences rather than racial differences\n\n        comparing black women to men is a superior model. Other racial groups do not share the loss\n\n        of gender-related cardioprotection found in blacks, and have been excluded. Further the\n\n        advantage of comparing black men and women is that this comparison provides a better\n\n        control of dietary, cultural and genetic factors.\n\n\n\n        Age: The age range of the participants will be between 18 and 70 years. As stated in the\n\n        original protocol on page 14: Future investigations are planned which will involve similar\n\n        comparisons between premenopausal and postmenopausal black women and between whites and\n\n        blacks. To investigate risk for glucose intolerance, diabetes and cardiovascular risk\n\n        factors, it is no longer sufficient to maintain the age range between 18 and 50 years. We\n\n        need to expand to an age range with an increased prevalence of these risk factors.\n\n\n\n        Medical History: To participate in the study subjects should identify themselves as\n\n        healthy. This is important so the broadest possible sample of people will enroll. The fact\n\n        that people are healthy will be confirmed by the history, physical and laboratory tests\n\n        done as part of the screening visit. People with established coronary artery as evidenced\n\n        by history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass surgery or PTCA will be allowed\n\n        to participate if they are not currently having angina.\n\n\n\n        CRITERIA FOR EXCLUSION:\n\n\n\n        Black Ethnicity other than American or African.\n\n\n\n        As stated in the inclusion criteria black people are a multi-ethnic group. In this initial\n\n        investigation we are focusing on African Americans who are American born and Africans\n\n        living in the United States who are African born. In the future, we will expand the study\n\n        to include other groups of blacks such as individuals of Afro-Caribbean and Hispanic\n\n        blacks.\n\n\n\n        Medications: People who take medications that are known to alter the parameters which are\n\n        under investigation in this study will be excluded. People taking medications to treat\n\n        hyperlipidemia will be included but analyses will be adjusted to take this into account.\n\n        Subjects on thyroid hormone replacement will be included if their TSH is normal.\n\n\n\n        Diabetes: Because diabetes affects insulin sensitivity and TG levels all people with\n\n        diabetes even if the diabetes is controlled with diet alone will not be enrolled in the\n\n        study.\n\n\n\n        Pregnant or Breastfeeding: Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have an infant that is\n\n        less than four months of age will be excluded. This is because the physiologic changes\n\n        associated with pregnancy, breastfeeding or recent childbirth affect the parameters under\n\n        study.\n\n\n\n        Menstrual History: Now that postmenopausal women are included, menstrual history will be\n\n        taken but women with irregular menses and hysterectomy will not be excluded. Women between\n\n        the ages of 40 and 55 years will have FSH checked for proper characterization. Women 56\n\n        years of age and older will be assumed to be postmenopausal. However, women on any type of\n\n        injectable hormonal contraception will be excluded because hormonal contraception affects\n\n        both TG levels and glucose metabolism.\n\n      "],

          "\n      BACKGROUND:\n\n\n\n      Approximately 10 percent of premature coronary artery disease (CAD) morbidity and mortality\n\n      in the general population is due to insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). By age 55, 35\n\n      percent of IDDM patents die of CAD, in contrast to only 8 percent of nondiabetic men and 4\n\n      percent of women. In the U.S., IDDM affects at least 750,000 persons and this number is\n\n      growing rapidly as the effect of increasing incidence and improved survival. Tight blood\n\n      glucose control can slow the development of microvascular complications but a protective\n\n      effect on heart disease has not been convincingly demonstrated.\n\n\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n\n\n      This observational population-based study evaluated cross- sectionally a population-based\n\n      group of 656 IDDM patients aged 20-55 years and 764 of their non-diabetic spouse/partner\n\n      controls using the electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT). Patients and controls were\n\n      compared in terms of the amount and anatomical distribution of coronary artery calcium (CAC),\n\n      a marker of atherosclerosis, and the left ventricular (LV) area, a marker of LV hypertrophy\n\n      and diabetic cardiomyopathy. The demographic, metabolic, and behavioral factors associated\n\n      with increased CACand LV area were defined. Standard epidemiological methods were used to\n\n      determine the prevalence of clinical CAD, defined by previous MI, revascularization, or\n\n      angina in the study population. In 100 asymptomatic high-risk IDDM patients (CAC greater than\n\n      or equal to 20 or LV area greater than 60 cm2), in 50 low-risk patients (CAC and LV area\n\n      below these cut-offs), and in 20 nondiabetic controls age-sex matched to the high-risk\n\n      patients, ECG-gated rest-stress technetium-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed\n\n      tomographic imaging (MIBI SPECT) was performed. This helped to determine the presence of\n\n      myocardial perfusion defects and to quantify myocardial perfusion reserve as well as to\n\n      relate these findings anatomically to the distribution of CAC by EBCT. In addition, LV\n\n      volumes, ejection fraction, wall motion and thickening were determined, and related to LV\n\n      area by EBCT. Finally, the study cohort of 656 IDDM patients and 764 non diabetic\n\n      spouses/partners were followed up for a period of 3 years to measure the change in CAC and LV\n\n      area using a repeat EBCT and to identify the metabolic and behavioral risk factors for\n\n      progression in these indices. Cause-specific mortality was monitored and all fatal and\n\n      non-fatal cardiac events were ascertained. In the subgroup of 100 high-risk IDDM patients\n\n      studied with the MIBI SPECT at the baseline and in all low-risk patients whose CAC increased\n\n      by more than 50 during the follow-up, MIBI SPECT was used to evaluate the change in\n\n      myocardial perfusion, LV volumes, ejection fraction, wall motion and thickening, as well as\n\n      to relate these findings to the change in CAC and LV area by EBCT.\n\n\n\n      The study was extended to follow the cohort for an additional three years to achieve the\n\n      following specific aims: 1. To determine, among type 1 diabetic (T1D) patients and comparable\n\n      controls, the risk factors for: a. 6-year progression of electron-beam tomography (EBT)\n\n      defined coronary calcification - marker of coronary atherosclerosis b. 6-year development of\n\n      myocardial perfusion defects and changes in relative myocardial perfusion reserve defined\n\n      using ECG-gated rest-stress technetium-99m MIBI SPECT imaging c. 6-year incidence of clinical\n\n      CAD, defined by fatal and non-fatal MI, revascularization or angina, as well as stroke,\n\n      peripheral artery disease and cause-specific mortality. 2. To develop a clinically useful\n\n      measure of insulin sensitivity that is directly comparable between T1D patients and\n\n      non-diabetic persons to more precisely determine the role of insulin resistance in\n\n      development of premature CAC in type I diabetes.\n\n    ",
